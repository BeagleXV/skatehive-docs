# You need Wallets Yo!

Listen up folks, you need wallets like you need air to breathe! Software wallets are the ultimate tool for managing your digital assets, like cryptocurrencies, and for being the cool kid on the block in the decentralized web3 world. A wallet is basically a fancy alphanumeric code, also known as a private key, that is randomly generated and belongs to you and only you. Once you have one of these bad boys, you can import your private key into various software options, such as mobile apps, browser extensions, or offline apps, for different purposes.

Creating a wallet for the average user is as easy as:

> **Step 1)** Clicking a button.

> **Step 2)** Generating a private key that looks something like this:

or 

`blue house dick bearings ...` 

> **Step 3)** Importing your private key into a recommended software to use your wallet and be the envy of all your friends.
